Added a very large map (16x8x3 overmap tiles + a little more): a nuclear power plant. There are two power units here. 
Each power unit is a graphite light-water nuclear reactor with an electric power
 of 1000 MW with a reactor central hall, deaerator, two steam drums, pool bubbler, 8 main circulation pumps, control room, server room,
 2 turbogenerators with a capacity of 500MW in engine room, ventilation with exhaust pipe, many corridors and various staff offices.

I tried to be realistic. In many rooms there is nothing to take.

Some equipment is not present in the game, so I replaced it with what I found.

There should also be an assembly shop and an administration building here, I'm a bit tired of fiddling with this map, maybe I'll add it later.
